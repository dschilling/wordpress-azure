= Collect Email Template =

Building your email subscriber list is one of the most important aspects of building your brand and increasing sales.  Our exit intent overlays and popups engage the user as they are about to leave your site.  You can also trigger the popup after a few seconds.

= Call To Action Template =

Use this Call to Action template to direct users to a specific page or offer when they are about to leave the site.  Great to attract attention as a visitor is abandoning the site.

= Yes/No Template =

Similar to the Call To Action template but with 2 options.  Great for rhetorical questions like "Do you Like Bouncing Users?  Yes, I do.  No, I like new leads"

= Social Sharing Template =

Increase Facebook Likes, Facebook Shares, Tweets, and Google +1's with our social sharing template.  This popup can quickly increase your social user brands.

= Display Coupon Template =

Offer visitors coupons as they are about to leave your site from specific pages to increase sales and conversions.

= Feedback Template =

Gather real-time unbiased feedback from users of your site.  Ask survey questions and gain valuable insight into your business.

= Outbound Email Sequences =

Once you add new subscribers, trigger unique email sequences to convert the subscribers into customers.  Add send rules, custom templates, photos, and more to each step in your sequence.

= Easily customize design =

Each template is completely customizable. Quickly change wording, fonts, colors, logos and background images to match the rest of your website.

= A/B testing your pop ups =

You can create multiple popup campaigns to test the effectiveness of different images, text, and messages.  Track impressions and conversions to see which perform the best.

Trigger the popup when a user moves their mouse to the top of the page as they are leaving your site.  This is one of the most unobtrusive and effective ways to gather leads.
